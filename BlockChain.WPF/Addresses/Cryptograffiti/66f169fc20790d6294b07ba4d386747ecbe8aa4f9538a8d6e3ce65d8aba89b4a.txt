Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Bjørn Magnhildøen, I'm an unknown artist working with new
technology, living under precarious conditions being dependent on
government support for my work and life. I'm writing you this message
because I, too, wondered whether I could not sell something and succeed
in life. For some time I had been no good at anything. I am forty-nine
years old... Finally the idea of inventing something insincere finally
crossed my mind and I set to work straightaway. By the beginning of
august I had started spamming the blockchain. 'But is it art?' you may
ask. What is it? In fact it is objects. And if you're willing to exhibit
it we'll make a deal if you should sell something.

Kindly reply me to my private email: bjornmag@noemata.net

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards

Bjørn Magnhildøen
