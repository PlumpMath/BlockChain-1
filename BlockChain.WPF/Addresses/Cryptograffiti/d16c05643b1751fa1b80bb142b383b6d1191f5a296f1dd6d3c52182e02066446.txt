10thjuly2016 name:TERPENE MIXING  (4th dimension 1985) smellaroma
process has been in development since jan 2013 to mix terpenes and dispense them in amounts as small as 3 picolitres.
technology uses high frequency ceramic cartridge similar to inkjet printer cartridge.
software control is 8bit per terpene giving 255 levels and is mixed similar to rgb colour mixing.
example..62% pinene, 27% myrcene and 11% limonene would have an rgb ratio as 158:69:28 and
would dispense pine resin.billions of combinations are possible with a 6 cartridge system.
any cannabis terpene profile can be recreated as opensource data is available for most cultivars.
the hardware device is currently as big as an inkjet printer but size will be reduced.
it will now be possible to email a bunch of roses and when the recipient opens the email
they will get a smell of roses dispensed immediately,or a sample of perfume,wine,cheese etc
now you can smell before you buy.
